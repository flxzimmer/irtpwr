\arguments{
\item{hyp}{Hypothesis Object created by the setup.hypothesis function}

\item{stat}{character vector containing the statistics to be calculated. Options are "Wald","LR","Score", and "Gradient". By default, all statistics are included}

\item{method}{character, indicating the method used. The options are "analytical"(default) for the analytical power analysis method or "sampling" for the sampling-based method. The sampling-based method is generally recommended for higher numbers of items.}

\item{sampling.npers}{integer, sample size for the sampling-based approach}

\item{approx.npers}{integer, sample size for approximating the Fisher expected information matrix in the sampling-based approach}

\item{SE.type}{Method for calculation of the observed information matrix used for calculating the statistics in the sampling-based approach ("Oakes" by default). Another option is "Fisher".}

\item{sampling.mat}{Approach to calculate the information matrix used for calculating the statistics in the sampling-based approach. By default ("ApproxFisher"), an sampling-based approximation of the expected Fisher matrix is calculated using an observed information matrix of the type SE.type}

\item{power}{numeric, statistical power for which the necessary sample size is calculated}

\item{N}{integer, sample size for which the statistical power is calculated.}

\item{alpha}{numeric, alpha level}
}
\value{
function returns an object of class irtpwrresult
}
\description{
